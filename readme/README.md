Project Overview:
This project is a fully designed multi-page e-commerce website for STARRYCJ, a modern lifestyle and technology brand. The website simulates a complete online shopping experience, including browsing products, adding items to a cart, applying vouchers, selecting payment methods, and completing checkout.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate strong front-end development fundamentals by building a clean, visually appealing, and user-friendly website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site focuses on clear navigation, responsive layouts, and interactive elements that mimic real-world e-commerce behaviour.

Overall, this project acts as a functional prototype of an online store while showcasing UI/UX design, layout structuring, and basic client-side logic.

Design Process:
The website was designed with online shoppers in mind. Users visiting the site should be able to:

- Browse products easily
- View product details clearly
- Add and remove items from the cart
- Apply vouchers and see updated totals
- Choose a payment method smoothly
- Complete checkout with minimal friction
- To Provide feedback based on the products

The layout prioritises clarity, consistency, and accessibility. Visual hierarchy, spacing, and colour usage were carefully planned to guide users naturally through the shopping journey from product discovery to payment confirmation.
